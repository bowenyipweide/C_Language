#Why call it a black box? 
if we aren't writing the function ourselves, we don't need to know the underlying implementation.

#functions declaration:
  return-type name(argument-list);
The "return-type" is what kind of variuable the function will output. 
The "name" is what you want to call your functions.
The "Argument-list" is the comma-seperated set of input to your functions, each of which has a type and a name.
