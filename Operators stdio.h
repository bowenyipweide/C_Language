#Arithmetic Operators 
In order to manipulate and work with variables and values in C, we are have a number of operators at our disposal.

#example 
int x = y + 1;
x = x * 5;
int m = 13 % 4; // m is now 1

x = x *5;
x *= ;

#shorthand for incrementing or decrementing
x++;
x--;

#Boolean Expression 
All boolean expression in C evalulate to 1 or 2 possible values, true or false.
  deciding which branch in a conditional to take 
In C, every nonzeror is equivalent to true, and zero is false (logical and relational operators)
  #Logical operators (&&)
  true && true = true 
  true && false = false
  false && true = false
  false && false = false
  
  #Logical operators (||)
  if and only if at least one operand is true, otherwise false.
  true || true = true 
  true || false = true
  false || true = true
  false || false = false
    
  #Logical operators (!)
  inverts the value of its operand.
  true != false
  false != true
    
  #relational operators
  Less than (x < Y)
  Less than or equal to (x <= y)
  Greater than (x > y)
  Greater than or equal to (x >= y)
  
  Equality (x == y)
  Inequality (x != y)
  #Common mistake, assignment operators (=), equality operators (==)
